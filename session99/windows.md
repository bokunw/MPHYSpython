Windows
=======

Python
------

We recommend installing a complete scientific python distribution. One of these is
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

Please download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
(Python 3.6 version).

Sophos
------

To use the IPython notebook on a Windows computer with Sophos anti-virus installed it may be necessary to
open additional ports allowing communication between the notebook and its server.
The [solution](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13036197/ipython-notebook-getting-output) is:

* open your Sophos Endpoint Security and Control Panel from your tray or start menu
* Select "configure" > "Anti-virus" > "Authorization" from the menu at the top
* Select the websites tab
* click the "Add" button and add 127.0.0.1 and localhost to the "Authorized websites" list
* restart computer (most likely not needed, just restart the IPython notebook)
* output works now :)

Git
----

Install the [GitHub for Windows client](http://windows.github.com/). This comes with both a GUI
client as well as the [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) terminal client which we will use during
the course. You should register with [Github](https://github.com) for an account and sign into the
GUI client with this account. This will automatically set-up
[SSH based authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys#platform-windows)
for the terminal client. The terminal client comes in 3 different flavours based on Windows CMD
(DOS like), Windows Powershell, and BASH. We will use the BASH client as this most closely resembles the
Linux and OS X terminal used by other students. In order to configure this open the Github
client. Sign in with your credentials and:

*  Select tools
*  Options
*  Default Shell
*  Git Bash
*  And Press Update to save.

Verify that this is working by opening Git Bash. The Shell window should have a title that
starts with MINGW32.

Editor
-------

Unless you already use a specific editor which you are comfortable with we recommend using
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Using VSCode to edit text files including code should be straight forward but in addition you
could configure [Git Bash](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) and
[python prompt](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).


Testing your install
-------------------------

Check this works by opening the Github shell. Once you have a terminal open, type

``` bash
which code
```

which should produce readout similar to `/c/Program Files (x86)/Code/Code.exe`

Also verify the typing:
```bash
code
```
opens the editor and the close it again.

``` bash
which git
```

which should produce `/bin/git`. The ``which``
command is used to figure out where a given program is located on disk.

Telling Git about VS Code
-------------------------

Now we need to update the default editor used by Git.

``` bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

Note that it is not obvious how to copy and paste text in a Windows terminal including Git Bash.
Copy and paste can be found by right clicking on the top bar of the window and selecting the
commands from the drop down menu (in a sub menu).

Testing python
--------------

Confirm that the Python installation has worked by typing:

``` bash
python -V
```

Which should result in details of your installed python version.

This should print the installed version of the python and git confirming that both are installed at
working correctly.

You should now have a working version of git, python, and notepad++, all accessible from your shell.
