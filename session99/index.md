Installation Instructions
=========================

Introduction
------------

This document contains instructions for installation of the packages we'll be using during the
course. You will be following the training on
your own machines, so please complete these instructions.

What we're installing
---------------------

For the software carpentry session on programming, we'll be using the language *Python* and in
particular versions >= 3.5. We will use the *Enthought Canopy* python distribution which contains a good
collection of the most common *Python* modules as well as *IPython* (an improved *Python*
interpreter) and the IPython notebook (a useful web-based user interface that allows you to create
documents that combine text and *Python* code, executable with the same browser window).  We'll need
*pip*, the package installer for *Python*, as well.

For the session on version control, we'll be using *Git* and the *Github* website.

Eduroam
-------

We will be using UCL's [eduroam](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/staff/wireless/eduroam) service to connect
to the internet for this work.

So you should ensure you have eduroam installed and working.
